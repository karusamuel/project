    ">In this analysis, we explore the relationship between advertising expenditures across different media channels (TV, Radio, and Newspaper) and the sales of a product. Understanding how different types of advertising spending affect sales is crucial for businesses to optimize their marketing strategies and allocate resources effectively. By analyzing the Advertising dataset, which contains data on advertising spend and corresponding sales, we aim to uncover key insights that can guide data-driven decisions for future advertising campaigns. Our analysis includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical tests, regression modeling, and evaluation of model performance to draw meaningful conclusions and provide actionable recommendations"
